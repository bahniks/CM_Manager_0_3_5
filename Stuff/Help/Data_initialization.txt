@Process

Whenever file containing carousel maze data is loaded, data are automatically processed 
to fill in missing data for further usage by CMM. $n 
Most importantly, missing values are filled in by CMM. Missing values are those, that
have x- and y-coordinates equal to zero. If these values are at the beginning, they
are simply removed. If they are in the middle of the data, they are imputed by
linear approximation. Finally, if they are at the end and linear approximation is 
therefore not possible, they are imputed with use of last non-missing position.
