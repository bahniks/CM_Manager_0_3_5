Explore part of the CMM is meant for exploration of carousel maze files. $n
It should enable such exploration with use of animation showing movement of an animal 
during a session and by use of graphs depicting various information related to animal's
movement. $nn
It's important to note that file is $l$initialized$Data_initialization when loaded similarly as when the process part of CMM is used. $nn
It's possible to change speed of animation with slider at the right of the window
(0.5x - 50x acceleration of the real time). $n
Left button mouse click on the graph results in shift of the time position of the 
animation. $n
Shocks are displayed by change of color of the dot representing rat. They are displayed only when the current wasn't 0 mA.
