Carousel Maze Manager (heretofore CMM) is a program for working with data from carousel
maze gathered with Tracker (by Bio-Signal Group). It is tested with files from Tracker version 2.33, however, it is likely that it would work with files with similar output
as well. $nn
So far, CMM has two parts - $l$Processor$Process and $l$Explorer.$Explore $n The former
is meant for general analysis of data from carousel maze. It's output is in a form
of parameters computed from batch of data files. $n 
The latter is meant for exploration of data from carousel maze data files. It's possible
to interactively look at path travelled by animal that is showed as an animation with
Explorer.
