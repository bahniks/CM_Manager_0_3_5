Process part of the CMM analyses carousel maze data. $nn
There are two possible ways how to select dat a files for processing. $n The first is 
with 'Add Directory' button which searches the seleceted directory and all its sub-directories for .dat files and adds files in right format to storage for processing.
$n The second possibility is to selecet files manually with 'Add Files' button. Only
.dat files can be selected. $n 
CMM automatically matches files that has same name with an exception of a frame part,
where the frame part is a part of the name containing 'arena', 'Arena', 'room' or 'Room'.
If file that has no counterpart with the opposite frame part (where opposite frame part
must have same capitalization) is selected, it is added to storage of non-matching files.
$n It's possible to select only one file with either room or arena frame part and the other will be recognized. $n 
Files with same name in different directories aren't matched. $n 
If files are added, which are already in the storage for processing, they are not added
again. $n
So far, it's not possible to look at selected files and non-matched files. $n
